# BigCommerce Note:
#
# This is a modified version of the run file provided in the original Confluent
# distribution. We remove potential security leaks such as verbose/xtrace
# settings, and the env var dumps. We also inject a pre-configure script which
# is able to download a bootstrap script from S3 to run before everything boots
# up, allowing us to grab secrets and other runtime values.
